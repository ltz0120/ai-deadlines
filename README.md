## Deadlines for international conferences in machine learning and artificial intelligence

I used to maintain locally a clumsy spreadsheet -- now I'm using this, directly hosted on my website. I only list conferences I consider participating in (submitting papers, attend, and/or contribute as a member of program committees).

To add or update a deadline:
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `note` and `abstract_deadline` in case the conference has a separate mandatory abstract deadline

This is a fork from the excellent [ai-deadlines](https://github.com/abhshkdz/ai-deadlines).
